# Salary predictions (Group 3)

## Overview

Salary is one of the most important factors that influence the decision of an individual to choose a specific workplace or career path. “How much should the salary be?” is a difficult question and it certainly depends on several factors. That was one of the main objectives of our research through the proposed machine learning model, to find out which factors could be more decisive for the salary and if we could find a noteworthy pattern or strong relationship. Salary is not only a key element for companies to attract top talent but also a way to keep employees motivated and give recognition to their contributions, resulting in the retention of this talent. “A high salary ensures that employees are compensated fairly for their skills, experience, and expertise “(Srivastava, 2023). 
## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirmahdiabbootalebi/salary-by-job-title-and-country. This dataset provides a comprehensive collection of salary information from various industries and regions across the globe. Sourced from reputable employment websites and surveys, it includes details on job titles, salaries, job sectors, geographic locations, and more. Analyze this data to gain insights into job market trends, compare compensation across different professions, and make informed decisions about your career or hiring strategies. The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed for ease of analysis and is available under an open license for research and data analysis purposes.

## Model

The predictive model is built using r and mlr3 The steps involved in the modeling process are as follows:

1. Data preprocessing: Cleaning, encoding categorical variables, handling missing values.
2. Feature selection: Identifying significant features impacting salary predictions.
3. Model selection: Trying various algorithms like linear regression, random forest, etc.
4. Model evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, etc.
